		<h1>Initial Thoughts<h1>

		<p style="color: red;"> At first I found coding to be impossible. I had no idea how to start, where to begin, and no clue what the end result would be. I came into this a blank slate but was pleasantly surprised after a couple of hours of tutorials everything began to make sense and come together.</p>
		
		<h1>In the end<h1>
		<p style="color: red;"> I was amazed at the whole process and short-forms used in this line of work. Throughout this whole process my respect for programers and developers has increased substantially since I can not believe the work that goes into the main skeleton of digital work.</p>
