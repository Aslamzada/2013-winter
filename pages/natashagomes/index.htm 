<p>
I am looking forward to finishing up my last year in Graphics Communications Management at Ryerson! I am hoping to learn how to build a professional online presence to network once I graduate!

I am very much a simple soul that enjoys cooking, watching Netflix in bed and shopping on eBay. As you can see, my use of the digital world is limited to browsing Foodgawker for recipes, watching documentaries on Netflix and indulging in online shopping. With EID100, I am looking to expand my use more into social media and other realms of the digital world.	</p>
