<h1>Sanarya Rashad</h1>
Hello! I'm Sanarya Rashad. I was born in Iraq, raised in Canada, and currently residing half in North York, Ontario, half in Ryerson University. I'm fourth year biology student. I hate biology so muchhhh but it is the only subject that I'm good at.
My dream is to be a dentist one day in the near future.
