	<h1> All About Dana </h1>
	<body style= "background-color: Brown">
	
	<p> My name is Dana Roberts. I am a third year Ryerson Journalism student. I am currently designing a basic website, using code, for EID100. This is a task that is meant to familiarize people like me with the language of computer code. I have never experienced code before, so this is a great assignment to teach me.
</p>
<p> When I am not at school, you will most likely find me at Tim Hortons. I work there full time as an Assistant Manager. The joys of working in a fast food restaraunt are plentiful.  

<p> I am a big fan of using social media websites.  As a journalism student, it is vital that I maintain a prescence across most social networks.
