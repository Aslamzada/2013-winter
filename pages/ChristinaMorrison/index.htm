<p> Hi my name is Nino, which means kid in Spanish. I am a seven month old puppy and I am quite big for my age. I am already bigger than both my parents. My dad is a mix between a cocker spaniel and poodle, and my mom is mix between Maltese and poodle. Everyone tells me I am very calm for a puppy, but I still have moments of being extremely hyper. </p>
