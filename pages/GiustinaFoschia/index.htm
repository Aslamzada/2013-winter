		<td>Most people haven't heard about this visual bookmarking website because they are too busy on Pinterest. I suppose WHI is similar to that of Pinterest, but I prefer WHI's layout 		        much more. By adding the 'heart' button to your browser, you are able to add any image you find on the internet to WHI, add tags to it and organize it into a set. Follow people with        similar interests and you're bound to waste a ton of time on here.</td>

What I like the most about this website is that they offer extremely fast, free shipping anywhere in Canada! Oh, and they personally write on your receipt with a "Thank you" and/or a        smiley face. Cool people!</td>
